# Cirrhosis Patient Survival Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates how to use machine learning to predict the survival status of patients with cirrhosis using ensemble machine learning algorithms. The dataset used for this prediction includes various clinical features of the patients.

## Results

The accuracy and AUC score of the model will be printed in the console, and the confusion matrix and ROC curve will be displayed as plots.

## Conclusion

This guide provides a step-by-step approach to building and evaluating a machine learning model for predicting the survival status of patients with cirrhosis. Adjustments can be made to the preprocessing steps and the model parameters to improve performance. Using ensemble algorithms like Random Forest can enhance prediction accuracy and robustness, making them a valuable tool in medical predictions.
